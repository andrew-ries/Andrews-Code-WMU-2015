Update Log:


1) New function: Dupechecker. Checks for duplicate entries into array. [Could be better]
    need feature for capitalization. RegEx?
2) Stylized Error/File Creation Message with h2 tags for FileExists function

3) Updated sort/rsort functions to asort/arsort. Holds index number value when sorting. 
Scratch that, just had it working but ran into an error elsewhere, now it doesnt work. 
Was it working? Must SLEEP....Will look into it another day. 

NOTE: you switched CreateTable function names





Need To:
1 - better CSS positioning of table
2 - change how user can exceed 10 songs, currently "pushes one off the edge"
3 - Reduce amount of .php pages
4 - nicer nav, submit buttons
5 - clean up backups, .txt extension not seen in backups dir 
6 - copy function
7 - if you get this far check your notes for anything else you wrote down
